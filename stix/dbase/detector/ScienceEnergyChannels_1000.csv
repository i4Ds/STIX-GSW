,,,,,,,
Criteria,,,,,,,
,Quasi-Logarithmic spacing between Emin and Emax,,,,,,
,Monatonically increasing bin width,,,,,,
,Energy edges at integral values of keV,,,,,,
,"Fine resolution through microflare regime, 4-15 keV",,,,,,
,"Bracket Ba=133 lines at 31, 35 and 81 keV",,,,,,
,Boundary at Tungsten K-edge at 70 keV,,,,,,
,Include channels <4kev and >150keV,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Basic constraint,,,,,,,
,Emin,0,,,,,
,Emax,>1000,,,,,
,Number of bins,32,,,,,
