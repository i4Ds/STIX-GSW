ENERGY BINNING,,,,,,,01.02.23
,,,,,,,
Energy binning with masks reset after January 2023 fine energy test but ELUT unchanged.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Criteria,,,,,,,
,Increasing bin width between 4 keV and 150 keV,,,,Include LLD and ULD channels < 4kev and > 150keV,,
,"Fine (< 1kev) resolution through microflare regime, 4-11 keV",,,,,,
,Bin centres at 6.7 and 8.0 keV (Fe and Fe/Ni line complexes),,,,,,
,Sufficient coverage over full range,,,,,,
,"Bracket Ba-133 lines at 31, 35 and 81 keV",,,,,,
,Boundary at Tungsten K-edge at 70 keV,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Basic constraint,,,,,,,
,Emin,0,,,,,
,Emax,>1000,,,,,
